\section{Introduction}

Overleaf\footurl{https://www.overleaf.com/} is popular online \LaTeX{} editor. It can generate PDF files 
without need to install a local \TeX{} distribution. Unfortunatelly, it doesn't support conversion to HTML out of the box. To get the HTML version of the document, we must use some tricks.

There are many tools that support the conversion from \LaTeX{} to HTML, each of them use a different approach. I am a developer of \TeX4ht\footurl{https://tug.org/tex4ht/}, so I will present solution that uses this tool. 

\TeX4ht uses \TeX{} for the actual conversion. It loads special configuration files for internal \LaTeX{} code or for the used packages. These configuration files patch commands with special instructions that insert HTML (or other supported formats). Because it uses \TeX{} for the actual conversion, it supports custom commands. It also supports font changing commands, so  it doesn't need custom configurations in many cases.

It is possible to create a custom build file for Latexmk\footurl{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples/testing-html-export-with-tex4ht/rqcknjvwyyry} 
that uses \TeX4ht for the conversion, but the generated HTML file is not easilly accessible.  

To make the conversion easier, I've set up Docker image\footurl{https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/michalh21/make4ht-docker/general} for \TeX4ht. 
Thanks to GitHub Actions\footurl{https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-github-actions}, 
it is possible to use this image for the conversion of the Overleaf document to HTML. 
The generated files can be published on the web using Github Pages, where they can be automatically 
updated on every document change.

\section{Setup}

\subsection{On Overleaf}

First step is to sync your Overleaf project with your GitHub account, following a guide at 
Overleaf\footnote{\href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_do_I_connect_an_Overleaf_project_with_a_repo_on_GitHub,_GitLab_or_BitBucket\%3F}
{\texttt{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How\_do\_I\_connect\_an\_Overleaf\_project\_with\_a\allowbreak\_repo\_on\_GitHub,\_GitLab\_or\_BitBucket\%3F}}}. 
Don't forget to run the \cmdname{Sync -> GitHub} command from Overleaf main menu every time you had updated the document.

\subsection{On GitHub}
Next step is to configure actions in the Github project created for your document. Two steps are necessary -- first  one compiles the document to HTML using \TeX4ht, the second step publishes the generated HTML files on the Web using GitHub Pages\footurl{https://pages.github.com/}

For the web publishing we will use the \verb|actions-gh-pages| action\footurl{https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages}. Follow \href{https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages\#1-add-ssh-deploy-key}{the instructions} and create the keys.

When the keys are set up, you can create the workflow file. Select the \cmdname{Actions} tab and click the \cmdname{Set up a workflow yourself} button. It will open an editor with a YAML file for the Action workflow. Replace it with the following content:

\begin{lstlisting}{yaml}
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Run make4ht
      uses: docker://michalh21/make4ht-docker:latest
      env:
        command: "make4ht -u -d out main.tex"
    - name: Publish the web pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v2.5.0
      env:
        ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY }}
        PUBLISH_BRANCH: gh-pages
        PUBLISH_DIR: ./out    
\end{lstlisting}

The important part of the configuration is the \cmdname{command} key. It contains the actual command used for the compilation. We use Make4ht\footurl{https://ctan.org/pkg/make4ht?lang=en}, build system for \TeX4ht.
Command \verb|"make4ht -u -d out main.tex"| creates UTF-8 encoded HTML file from the \cmdname{main.tex} input file. The \texttt{-d} option specifies the output directory for the HTML files. This directory will be used for the web publishing and should be passed to the \verb|PUBLISH_DIR|.

The web will be published at \url{https://yourgitubusename.github.io/project_name/main.html}.
